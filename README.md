# Mbizmarket Mobile Apps Tech Radar

Tech Radar for Mbizmarket's Mobile App. List of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called Ring Assignment. We use four rings with following semantics:

* **ADOPT** - For technologies in the adopt ring, we feel strongly that the industry should be adopting these items. We use them where appropriate on our projects; as close to a "no brainer" as possible.

* **TRIAL** - The trial ring is for technologies you (and/or your peers) have decided are worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to build up this capability. Now is the time to pilot a low-risk project to "get dirty" with the technology so that you can really understand it.

* **ASSESS** - The assess ring indicates that a technology is worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will affect you. You should invest some effort (such as development spikes, research projects, attend conference sessions, etc.) to see if it will have an impact on your organization. For example, many large companies visibly went through this phase when formulating a mobile strategy.

* **HOLD** - The original intent of the hold ring was "hold off for now", to represent technologies that were too new to reasonably assess yet. We had in mind technologies that were getting lots of buzz but weren't yet proven. The hold ring has evolved into our way of saying "don't start anything new with this technology".
